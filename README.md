## Description
Suppose you want to sell any items online (like big eCommerce sites) – you have also decided
that you will also allow other partners/companies to sell their inventory on your site. Your
approach is to provide web service APIs for all functionalities that will provide access to your
items that you will sell and to provide your partners to be able to add their inventories to be
sold on your site using APIs.
